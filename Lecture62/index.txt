The continue statement in Java is used to skip the remaining code within the current iteration of a loop (for, while, or do-while) and move on to the next iteration. 
Here's how it works:
Encountering the continue statement: When the continue statement is encountered inside a loop, the remaining statements within the loop body for the current iteration are skipped.
Control flow: The control flow jumps to the end of the loop body. 
Next Iteration: The loop's condition is re-evaluated. If the condition is still true, the next iteration of the loop begins. If the condition is false, the loop terminates.
Example:
Java

for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    if (i == 3) {
        continue; // Skip iteration when i is 3
    }
    System.out.println("Value of i: " + i);
}
Output:
Code

Value of i: 1
Value of i: 2
Value of i: 4
Value of i: 5
In this example, when i equals 3, the continue statement is executed, causing the println statement to be skipped for that iteration. The loop then continues with the next iteration.
Common Use Cases:
Filtering Data:
The continue statement is useful when you want to filter data within a loop. If a certain condition is met, you can use continue to skip the processing of that particular item and move on to the next one.
Improving Performance:
In some cases, using continue can improve the performance of your code. By skipping unnecessary computations within a loop, you can reduce the overall execution time.
Simplifying Control Flow:
In certain situations, using continue can help simplify the control flow of your loop, making it easier to read and understand.

//Explanation
Graph Class: Uses a Map to store the adjacency list.
addVertex Method: Adds a vertex to the graph.
addEdge Method: Adds an edge between two vertices.
getAdjVertices Method: Returns the list of adjacent vertices for a given vertex.
printGraph Method: Prints the graph’s adjacency list.
Operations on Graphs
Traversal:
Depth-First Search (DFS): Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
Breadth-First Search (BFS): Explores all neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
Shortest Path Algorithms:
Dijkstra’s Algorithm: Finds the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph.
Bellman-Ford Algorithm: Finds the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices, handling negative weights.

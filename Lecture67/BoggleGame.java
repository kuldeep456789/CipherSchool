Boggle is a word game played on a 4x4 grid of letter dice. The goal is to find as many words as possible within a time limit by connecting adjacent letters.
// Here's a detailed explanation of the game and a breakdown of the code in Java:
// Game Rules:
// Board Generation: The game starts by randomly shaking a set of 16 dice, each with 6 letters on its faces. The dice are arranged in a 4x4 grid.
// Word Formation: Players search for words by connecting adjacent letters (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). A letter can only be used once in a word.
// Scoring: Words are scored based on their length. Longer words earn more points.
// Time Limit: Players typically have 3 minutes to find as many words as possible.
// Java Code Implementation:
// Board Representation: A 2D array can be used to represent the Boggle board.
// Java

char[][] board = new char[4][4];
Dictionary: A data structure like a Trie or a Set can be used to store a dictionary of valid words.
Java

Set<String> dictionary = new HashSet<>();
Word Search (Depth-First Search): A depth-first search (DFS) algorithm is commonly used to traverse the board and find words.
Java

private void searchWords(int row, int col, String currentWord, boolean[][] visited) {
    // Check if the current cell is valid
    if (row < 0 || row >= board.length || col < 0 || col >= board[0].length || visited[row][col]) {
        return;
    }

    // Append the current letter to the word
    currentWord += board[row][col];

    // Check if the word is a valid word in the dictionary
    if (dictionary.contains(currentWord)) {
        // Add the word to the list of found words
        foundWords.add(currentWord);
    }

    // Mark the current cell as visited
    visited[row][col] = true;

    // Recursively search for words in adjacent cells
    for (int i = row - 1; i <= row + 1; i++) {
        for (int j = col - 1; j <= col + 1; j++) {
            searchWords(i, j, currentWord, visited);
        }
    }

    // Unmark the current cell for further exploration
    visited[row][col] = false;
}
// Game Logic: The game logic handles tasks such as generating the board, managing the timer, validating words, and calculating scores.
// Example Code Structure:
// Java

public class BoggleGame {
    private char[][] board;
    private Set<String> dictionary;
    private Set<String> foundWords;

    // Constructor to initialize the game
    public BoggleGame() {
        // Initialize the board, dictionary, and found words
    }

    // Method to generate the board
    private void generateBoard() {
        // Randomly assign letters to the board
    }

    // Method to search for words
    private void searchWords() {
        // Use DFS to find words
    }

    // Method to play the game
    public void play() {
        // Generate the board
        // Start the timer
        // Get input from the player
        // Validate words
        // Calculate the score
        // End the game
    }
}
// Key Considerations:
// Dictionary Implementation: Trie data structures are efficient for prefix-based word searches.
// Pruning: Implement optimizations to avoid unnecessary searches (e.g., pruning branches of the DFS tree when a prefix is not found in the dictionary).
// User Interface: Consider how you will present the game board and interact with the player (e.g., using a graphical user interface or a command-line interface).

An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing a task. In Java, algorithms are often implemented as methods within classes. Let's delve deeper into the concept of algorithms in Java:
Components of an Algorithm:


Input: The data that the algorithm operates on.
Output: The result produced by the algorithm.
Definiteness: Each step of the algorithm must be precisely defined.
Finiteness: The algorithm must terminate after a finite number of steps.
Effectiveness: Each step must be feasible and executable.
Common Algorithm Categories:
Sorting Algorithms:
Arrange elements in a specific order (e.g., ascending or descending).
Examples: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort.
Searching Algorithms:
Locate a specific element within a data structure.
Examples: Linear Search, Binary Search.
Graph Algorithms:
Analyze and manipulate graph data structures.
Examples: Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm.
Dynamic Programming Algorithms:
Solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller overlapping subproblems.
Examples: Fibonacci sequence, Knapsack problem.
Greedy Algorithms:
Make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum.
Examples: Prim's Algorithm, Kruskal's Algorithm.
Divide and Conquer Algorithms:
Divide the problem into smaller subproblems, solve each subproblem recursively, and then combine their solutions to solve the original problem.
Examples: Merge Sort, Quick Sort.
